<h1>Breakout game clone</h1>
<h3>How to play:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The objective is to destroy all the bricks.</li>
  <li>Use the arrow keys to move your paddle left and right. Use it to make the ball bounce off it.</li> 
  <li>Hitting a brick earns you one point. Most bricks have more than one life and take multiple hits to be destroyed. The color of a brick corresponds to the number of lives it has left.</li>
  <li>You start the game with three lives. You lose a life when the ball touches the bottom edge of the screen. The game is over when you run out of lives.</li>
</ul>
